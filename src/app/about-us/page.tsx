            The Centro de Análisis para la Investigación en Innovación, A.C. (CAIINNO), is a Mexican think tank
            established by individuals who completed their studies abroad with the Fulbright scholarship and decided to
            return to Mexico to bring about positive change in the country.

            Their work has led them to receive national and international acclaim. For instance, they recently designed a
            project that was selected by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) during its call for "proposals for
            Latin America's and the Caribbean's recovery from COVID-19". Their proposal was the only one selected from
            Mexico and one of the ten chosen worldwide from among the nearly 300 received by the IDB.

            In 2020, the National Institute for Access to Information (INAI) honored them with the "Award for Innovation
            and Best Practices in the Protection of Personal Data", on account of the development and implementation of
            an artificial intelligence. In 2023 the INAI honored them with a special mention in the Innovation Award.

            such as the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
            Office, the Latin American Integration Association, and the United Nations Development Program, among others.
